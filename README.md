SuperTuxKart is a free kart racing game. It focuses on fun and not on realistic kart physics. Instructions can be found on the in-game help page.

The SuperTuxKart homepage can be found at <https://supertuxkart.net/>. There is also our [FAQ](https://supertuxkart.net/FAQ) and information on how get in touch with the [community](https://supertuxkart.net/Community)

## Hardware Requirements
To run SuperTuxKart, make sure that your computer's specifications are equal or higher than the following specifications:

* A graphics card capable of 3D rendering - NVIDIA GeForce 8 series and newer (GeForce 8100 or newer), AMD/ATI Radeon HD 4000 series and newer, Intel HD Graphics 3000 and newer. OpenGL >= 3.3
* You should have a CPU that's running at 1 GHz or faster. 
* You'll need at least 512 MB of free VRAM (video memory).
* Minimum disk space: 800 MB 
* Ideally, you'll want a joystick with at least 6 buttons.

## 3D coordinates
A reminder for those who are looking at the code and 3D models:

SuperTuxKart: X right, Y up, Z forwards

Blender: X right, Y forwards, Z up

The export utilities  perform the needed transformation, so in Blender you just work with the XY plane as ground, and things will appear fine in STK (using XZ as ground in the code, obviously).

## Building from source

In order to build SuperTuxKart from source, you'll need both the code and the assets (See <https://supertuxkart.net/Source_control> for more information):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code stk-code
svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/supertuxkart/code/stk-assets stk-assets
```

## Building SuperTuxKart on Linux

### Dependencies

To build SuperTuxKart from source, you'll need to install the following packages:

  * OpenGL (mesa)
  * OpenAL (recommended: openal-soft-devel)
  * Ogg (libogg-dev)
  * Vorbis (libvorbis-dev)
  * Freetype (libfreetype6-dev)
  * libcurl (libcurl-devel)
  * libbluetooth (bluez-devel)
  * libpng (libpng-devel)
  * zlib (zlib-devel)
  * jpeg (libjpeg-turbo-devel)

Ubuntu command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libbluetooth-dev \
libcurl4-gnutls-dev libfreetype6-dev libfribidi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev \
libjpeg-dev libogg-dev libopenal-dev libpng-dev libvorbis-dev libxrandr-dev \
mesa-common-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev
```
### In-game recorder

To build the in-game recorder for STK, you have to install
libopenglrecorder from your distribution, or compile it yourself from [here](https://github.com/Benau/libopenglrecorder).
Compilation instruction is explained there. If you don't need this feature, pass `-DBUILD_RECORDER=off` to cmake.

### Compiling

To compile SuperTuxKart, run the following commands inside `stk-code` directory:

```bash
mkdir cmake_build
cd cmake_build
cmake ..
make -j4
```
STK can then be run from the build directory with `bin/supertuxkart`

#### Keeping your build up to date

To recompile the latest code without redownloading the entire source, first run the ```svn up``` command inside the 'stk-assets' directory, then run the following commands inside the 'stk-code' directory:

```bash
git pull
cd cmake_build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

##### Build Speed Optimization

"-j4" is an example, for a faster build, use "-jx" instead, where "x" is the amount of CPU threads you have, minus one.

### Further options

To create a debug version of STK, run:

```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

You can install your build system-wide:

```bash
sudo make install
```

The default install location is `/usr/local`, i.e. the data files will
be written to `/usr/local/share/games/supertuxkart`, the executable
will be copied to `/usr/local/bin`. To change the default installation
location, specify `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` when running cmake, e.g.:
`cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/stk`



## Building SuperTuxKart on Windows
To Build SuperTuxKart on Windows, follow these instructions:

1. Download and install Visual Studio from here: [Visual Studio - Download](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). The free Visual Studio Community edition works fine.
2. Download the SuperTuxKart source package from either [SuperTuxKart download area - SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/supertuxkart/files/SuperTuxKart/) or [SuperTuxKart.net - Source Control](https://supertuxkart.net/Source_control), and unpack it. 
*Note: If you downloaded the source package from here: [SuperTuxKart.net - Source Control](https://supertuxkart.net/Source_control), then both `stk-code` and `stk-assets` **must** be in the same directory, otherwise the build can result in failure*
3. Download the Windows dependencies package from either [SuperTuxKart download area: Dependencies - SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/supertuxkart/files/SuperTuxKart%20Dependencies/Windows/)
or [SuperTuxKart on GitHub - Dependencies](https://github.com/supertuxkart/dependencies), and unpack it; then, copy the `dependencies` directory from either the `windows` or the `windows_64bit` directories into the `stk-code` directory, rename it to `dependencies-64bit` if you want to compile a 64bit build.
4. Download CMake from here: [CMake - download page](https://cmake.org/download/), install it; once CMake is installed, double click on the CMake icon on your desktop, and point it towards your `stk-code` directory in the 'Where is the source code' field, and point it to a directory called `build` or `bld` inside the stk-code directory.
5. Press 'Configure'; CMake will ask you if it is OK to create the aforementioned directory, press `Yes`. CMake will then ask you about your version of Visual Studio. 
Confirm your selection; *Please look at the table below to avoid confusion between version numbers and releases of Visual Studio*;
CMake will begin creating the required files for the build in the directory.
6. Navigate to your build directory and open the `SuperTuxKart.sln` file; Visual Studio will now load the solution. 
7. In the 'Solution Explorer', right click on the `supertuxkart` project and select "Set as StartUp project"
8. Open the 'Build' menu and select 'Build Solution'; or, press the default keyboard shortcut: `CTRL + SHIFT + B` to build the solution.

*Note: To avoid confusion between releases and versions, refer to this table:*

Visual Studio Release | Version
----------------------|------------
Visual Studio 2017| 15
Visual Studio 2015| 14
Visual Studio 2013| 13

## Building SuperTuxKart on Windows (from PowerShell/Command line)
1. Download and install Visual Studio from here: [Visual Studio - Download](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/), the free Visual Studio Community edition works fine.

2. Download a source package from either [SuperTuxKart 0.9.2 download area - SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/supertuxkart/files/SuperTuxKart/0.9.2) or [SuperTuxKart.net - Source Control](https://supertuxkart.net/Source_control)
NOTE: the `stk-code` and `stk-assets` directories **must** be in the same directory 
3. Download the Windows dependencies package from either [SuperTuxKart download area - SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/supertuxkart/files/SuperTuxKart%20Dependencies/Windows/)
or [SuperTuxKart on GitHub - Dependencies](https://github.com/supertuxkart/dependencies)
and unpack the archive; once unpacked, copy the `dependencies` directory from either the `windows` or the `windows_64bit` directories into the `stk-code` directory
4. Download CMake from here: [CMake - download page](https://cmake.org/download/); and install it. Navigate to the `stk-code` directory; and create an directory called "build":
```cmd
mkdir build
cd build
```
5. Once inside the build directory; run CMake to start the compilation process:
```cmd
cmake ..
```
6. Now that CMake finished configuring and creating the necessary files for the build, run the build command in the same directory:
```cmd
msbuild.exe SuperTuxKart.sln 
``` 
SuperTuxKart can now be run as `bin\Debug\supertuxkart.exe` or `bin\Release\supertuxkart.exe` 

## Building SuperTuxKart on macOS

### Getting Started

Install the developer tools, either from the OS X Install DVD or from Apple's website.

If you have never built anything before, you have create `/usr/local/include/` first:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/include/
```

Symlink the `include`-folder of OpenGL framework to `/usr/local/include/GL` (Unix programs have an easier time finding it this way):

```bash
sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/Headers/ /usr/local/include/GL
```

On OS X 10.9.5, you might need the following workaround:

```bash
sudo ln -s `xcrun --show-sdk-path`/usr/include/ /usr/include
sudo ln -s `xcrun --show-sdk-path`/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Headers/ /usr/local/include/OpenGL
```

The first link is required in order to find libcurl, the second to find opengl.

Download pre-built dependencies from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/supertuxkart/files/SuperTuxKart%20Dependencies/OSX/) and put the frameworks in [hard disk root]/Library/Frameworks

### CMake

CMake is used to build STK. At this time CMake will not make a binary that is ready for distribution.

You'll have to run these commands inside your stk-code directory.

### Building

With clang:

```bash
mkdir cmake_build
cd cmake_build
cmake ..
make
```

With GCC:
```bash
mkdir cmake_build
cd cmake_build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc
make
```

Building on 10.10 with 10.9 compatibility:
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk  -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9
```

### Xcode

Place an additional copy of the dependencies into `Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/Library/Frameworks`.
Then cd to your cloned stk-code directory and execute the following commands:

```bash
mkdir xcode_build && cd xcode_build
cmake .. -GXcode
```

Use Finder to navigate to your stk-code/xcode_build folder and open the newly generated Xcode project (`SuperTuxKart.xcodeproj`).

You can then build the project in Xcode using Product -> Build

Note: Xcode is much less well tested than makefiles, so there may be issues when trying to use Xcode.
